Cool README.md coming soon enough.

For now, to put it short, this is a fork of sinatra-twitter-bootstrap by mfojtik. Which you can check out at https://github.com/mfojtik/sinatra-twitter-bootstrap.

When I found it it was exactly what I was looking for, but I wanted bootstrap 3, so I made this fork just to bump the bootstrap and do a pull-request.
Bootstrap 3 was significantly different though, so I ended up having to do a major revamp of this 
(and some more will follow, when I add the helpers for grid and etc). Because of that, I decided to keep this fork separated, at least for now.
